# SSH Agent Integration Phase Progress

This is the single execution tracker for the task. Research, product requirements, design, scenario coverage, implementation order, and test strategy remain in this same task directory. A phase advances only after its focused checks pass; dependent phases run broader regression checks again.

## Phase Checklists

### S01 Config roots and launch injection

- [x] Add migration and types for Host preferences, project override, installations, and per-root integrations.
- [x] Add per-Host Claude/Codex config-root UI and optional SSH project override.
- [x] Resolve project override -> Host preference -> native default for every common SSH launch path.
- [x] Validate and safely expand absolute POSIX, `~`, and `~/...` roots at the Rust boundary.
- [x] Preserve remote integration identity when a Host is locally deleted.
- [x] Pass TypeScript, focused SSH launch tests, migration test, and full Rust library regression.
- [x] Update SSH contract, `[TEMP]` changelog, and feature inventory for delivered behavior.

### S02 Shared transport and Agent probe

- [x] Extract shared `SshTransportSpec` for interactive PTY and non-interactive one-shot launches.
- [x] Preserve SSH Config, Agent, identity-file, credential-reference, ProxyJump, proxy, AskPass, timeout, and Host Key parameters.
- [x] Add explicit per-Host Agent probe with bounded banner/stdout/stderr parsing and stable error classes.
- [x] Persist sanitized version/protocol/target/path/status metadata without credentials or remote output.
- [x] Add bilingual probe status and diagnostics without automatic connection on page open.
- [x] Add focused transport, probe parser, banner limit, path, protocol mismatch, and Agent target tests.
- [x] Pass full TypeScript and Rust regression after task consolidation.
- [x] Update executable SSH Agent contract and delivered-behavior documentation.
- [x] Complete repeated review/fix cycles until the final review has no findings.
- [x] Commit S02 independently (`feat(ssh): add agent transport and probe`).

#### S02 Review Log

1. Review 1 found truncated frame headers treated as clean EOF and an optional bridge protocol. Fixed strict partial-header errors and required `--protocol`; Agent tests passed.
2. Review 2 found a dead `target()` wrapper after transport extraction. Removed it and restored warning-free `cargo check`.
3. Review 3 found `doctor` could exit before reporting `unsupported_target` when HOME was unavailable. Made status/doctor always structured and prevented failed doctor diagnostics from being marked usable.
4. Review 4 found no further issues. Final evidence: `npx tsc --noEmit`; desktop `cargo check`; desktop library tests `551 passed, 1 ignored`; Agent tests `10 passed`; CLI doctor smoke returned structured JSON.

### S03 Agent install supply chain

- [x] Add explicit per-Host preview, SSH stdin upload install/upgrade, rollback, uninstall, custom root, discovery metadata, and bilingual diagnostics.
- [x] Add Agent-owned install locking, staged self-check, version directories, atomic `current/previous` and launcher switching, corrupt-record recovery, downgrade protection, rollback, and transactional uninstall.
- [x] Add one signed manifest for desktop and POSIX script installation, reuse the Tauri updater Minisign trust root, and enforce HTTPS/default plus explicit signed HTTP mirror policy.
- [x] Add Linux x64/aarch64 release artifacts, size/SHA-256/target/protocol verification, manifest generation, release upload, and path-scoped Ubuntu Agent CI.
- [x] Add HTTP(S) installer dry-run/custom-root/downgrade/uninstall options without modifying Hook configuration.
- [x] Pass TypeScript, desktop Rust, Agent host tests, Linux x64/aarch64 all-target checks, POSIX installer smoke, manifest smoke, migration tests, and diff checks.
- [x] Update README, `[TEMP]` changelog, feature inventory, and executable SSH Agent contract.
- [x] Complete repeated review/fix cycles until the final review has no findings.

#### S03 Review Log

1. Review 1 found custom-root upgrades did not automatically reuse the discovery record, corrupt records permanently blocked repair, missing records could bypass downgrade checks, signed URLs accepted query/fragment ambiguity, and the script lacked strict download bounds. Fixed the shared install and URL-policy roots.
2. Review 2 found remote operation JSON was parsed but not contract-validated, and uninstall could leave partial state after a mid-operation failure. Added strict marker/action/identity/version/protocol/path/source/hash validation and a quarantine/restore uninstall transaction.
3. Review 3 found successful script installation bypassed temporary cleanup via `exec`, staged self-check omitted `doctor --self`, same-version reinstall produced false previous metadata, and public keys could drift across updater/desktop/script. Fixed cleanup and version semantics, added POSIX smoke coverage, centralized the public key, and made release generation verify all trust-root copies.
4. Review 4 found no further S03 issues. Final evidence: `npx tsc --noEmit`; desktop `cargo check`; desktop library tests `561 passed, 1 ignored` after one unrelated AskPass socket flake passed three focused reruns and the full rerun; Agent host tests `14 passed`; Linux x64/aarch64 `cargo check --all-targets`; POSIX installer smoke; manifest/key-consistency smoke; `git diff --check`.

### S04 Remote Hook lifecycle

- [x] Implement Claude/Codex discovery, preview, install, upgrade, uninstall, and conflict diagnostics.
- [x] Preserve third-party configuration and remove only CLI-Manager-owned entries.
- [x] Implement bounded one-shot Hook IPC/spool behavior and lifecycle tests.

#### S04 Root-Cause And Discovery Record

- GitNexus was unavailable in this session. Discovery used the SSH Agent/Hook/terminal contracts plus `rg` call-site tracing before edits.
- Agent touchpoints checked: shared Hook schema, Claude/Codex structural adapters, root/symlink resolution, ownership matching, lock/journal transaction, installation records, one-shot runtime, spool namespace/limits/ACK, and bridge protocol.
- Desktop touchpoints checked: strict Hook report validation, SSH launch binding, daemon session ownership, bridge lifecycle, Hook payload routing, notification redaction, Replay routing, integration persistence, settings UI, and i18n.
- Confirmed unrelated/local-only: local/WSL Hook transport remains on the loopback path; remote cwd/transcript refs do not enter local history, transcript, filesystem, Git, snapshot, or provider APIs; SSH provider launch parameters remain discarded in both frontend and Rust.
- Root cause 1: spool/socket identity omitted `hostId` while bridge ownership was per SSH Host, so duplicate Host profiles for one Agent installation collided. The namespace now binds Host/client/installation on both Hook and hello paths.
- Root cause 2: canonical-root status mirroring copied one row's configured root into sibling Host/project rows, making the sibling UI state disappear. Mirrored reports now preserve each row's own configured root.
- Root cause 3: PTY launch treated Agent installation as sufficient for Hook delivery, creating an unnecessary SSH bridge before Hook installation. Bridge identity is now injected only for an effective root with validated `installed` Hook state and matching Agent/machine identity.
- Root cause 4: strict desktop validation accepted a duplicate Codex installation-record file in place of the second required file. Record file identity is now unique and must equal the complete report file set.
- Crash recovery remains fail-safe: a process crash can leave a stale Agent-owned installation record that blocks Agent removal, but it cannot overwrite user config; explicit Hook uninstall removes the stale record. Generic bounded preamble/hello timeout, heartbeat, cancellation, and idle lifecycle remain explicitly owned by S05.

#### S04 Review Log

1. Review 1 found retained-root symlink cleanup could follow a retargeted configured path, Hook spool gap bytes were outside quota accounting, SSH provider arguments survived at one backend boundary, and remote Hook Replay could call local Git snapshot logic. Added canonical identity cleanup, hard byte accounting, Rust provider isolation, and remote-path refusal.
2. Review 2 found config-root TOCTOU gaps, stale retained-root actions, bridge identity missing KeepAlive settings, stale bilingual delivery text, and incomplete HTTP(S)/explicit-Hook documentation. Fixed the shared boundaries and reran focused tests.
3. Review 3 found duplicate SSH Host profiles collided on one Agent socket/spool namespace, sibling integration rows overwrote configured roots, duplicate installation-record files passed strict validation, and Agent-only terminals created unnecessary Hook bridges. Fixed all four root causes and added focused regressions where a runnable harness exists.
4. Review 4 found no further S04 correctness, security, provider-isolation, remote-path, ownership, or documentation issues. S05 retains the generic reusable bridge timeout/heartbeat/cancellation work by design.

Final evidence: Agent `cargo fmt --check`; Agent tests `29 passed`; Agent Clippy with `-D warnings`; Linux x64/aarch64 Agent `cargo check --all-targets`; touched desktop Rust `rustfmt --check --config skip_children=true`; desktop `cargo check`; desktop tests `570 passed, 1 ignored`; `npx tsc --noEmit`; `git diff --check`. A repo-wide desktop Clippy attempt remains non-green with 75 accumulated crate-wide style warnings, including unrelated modules and Tauri command argument-count lints, so it is not used as the S04 gate.

### S05 Reusable Agent bridge runtime

- [x] Maintain at most one reusable bridge per Host/client while PTYs remain independent.
- [x] Implement framing, capabilities, bounded preamble/hello handshake timeout, heartbeat, cancellation, backpressure, reconnect, and shutdown.
- [x] Verify connection counts, multi-window ownership, banner contamination, and authentication-required behavior.

#### S05 Root-Cause And Discovery Record

- GitNexus remained unavailable. Contract + `rg` tracing confirmed `SshAgentBridgeManager` is owned only by the daemon session create/close path, while Agent `run_bridge/handle_frame` is owned only by `bridge --stdio` and protocol tests.
- Root cause 1: bridge stdout was read synchronously without a deadline, so a stuck preamble/hello could hold one of the two global connect permits indefinitely. A bounded reader thread and 32-frame sync queue now give preamble, hello, Hook drain, ACK, and heartbeat explicit receive deadlines.
- Root cause 2: only concurrent connection attempts were limited; established bridges were unbounded. A lifetime permit now caps active/waiting bridge processes at four while the existing reconnect gate remains two.
- Root cause 3: `bridge_already_active` was treated as permanent, so a replacement bridge could lose takeover during the old socket cleanup window. It now follows bounded jittered retry; permanent identity/protocol/authentication/Host Key failures still stop.
- Root cause 4: bridge replacement and release killed/waited for SSH children while holding the global Host registry lock. Registration/removal is now atomic, then child shutdown happens after the map lock is released.
- Root cause 5: bridge stderr was discarded, making `Permission denied`, passphrase/MFA, and Host Key failures indistinguishable from transient disconnects. The daemon drains all stderr, keeps at most 8 KiB in memory for classification, and logs only stable codes.
- Root cause 6: spool drain and ACK loaded the complete file into memory for every batch. Both paths now stream bounded records; malformed/oversized records fail closed and ACK cleanup removes temporary files without replacing the original spool.
- Boundary confirmation: protocol 1.1 adds only heartbeat/cancellation/backpressure and Hook delivery guards. No history/file/Git/provider RPC or remote path routing was introduced in S05; PTY processes remain independent and last-session release stops only the Host bridge.

#### S05 Review Log

1. Review 1 added the bounded reader, hard handshake/response timeouts, heartbeat, global bridge/connect permits, stable-period retry reset, +/-20% Host jitter, bounded cancellation registry, and last-session process reaping.
2. Review 2 found transient socket takeover was incorrectly permanent and consumed cancellation IDs remained in eviction order. Fixed both and added regressions.
3. Review 3 found malformed remote error/batch/ACK data could inflate logs or advance the cursor, and spool replay still allocated the full backlog. Added strict short-code, monotonic sequence/latest/ACK validation and streaming spool I/O.
4. Review 4 found child shutdown under the registry lock, a spawn/stop race, and discarded authentication/Host Key stderr. Moved process waits outside the map lock, closed the race, added bounded sanitized classification, and found no further S05 issues.

Final evidence: Agent protocol minor `1.1`; Agent `cargo fmt --check`; Agent tests `33 passed`; Agent Clippy with `-D warnings`; Linux x64/aarch64 Agent `cargo check --all-targets`; touched desktop Rust `rustfmt --check --config skip_children=true`; desktop `cargo check`; focused bridge tests `11 passed`; focused Agent probe tests `6 passed`; desktop full tests `584 passed, 1 ignored`; `npx tsc --noEmit`; `git diff --check`.
